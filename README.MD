I don't see much in terms of:
* Event/streaming processing. So things like SQS/kafka/pulsar/pubsub
* Caching. So things like redis
* General complex processing or coordination
* Anything more complex on the DB side
* No authentication
* Nothing in terms of containers
* Nothing in terms of real time, like websockets or longpolling or whatever
